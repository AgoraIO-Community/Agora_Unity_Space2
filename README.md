## Developer Environment Prerequisites
- Unity3d 2021.3 LTS
- Agora Developer Account
- Agora Signaling SDK ([version 2.1.9](https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/Agora_Unity_RTM_SDK_v2.1.9.zip) or newer)
	
## Quick Start



This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

  

### Obtain an App ID

  

To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.

2. Navigate in Agora Console on the left to **Projects** > **More** > **Create** > **Create New Project**.

3. Save the **App ID** from the Dashboard for later use.

  

### Run the Application

  

#### Build for desktop

1. Clone this repo and open the project from this folder
2. Download the latest Signaling SDK (aka RTM SDK)
3. Fill in App ID and Token (if enabled)  ![metademoeditor](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/UnityTransformSyncDemo/assets/1261195/4ac75350-1cb3-465a-9d71-5a931e34d89c)
4. Make sure if your AppID has token or not.  Things won't work if you don't supply a token if your AppID requires one.  We recommend use an AppID for testing first before applying token logic.
5. Make a build and run it with the Editor
